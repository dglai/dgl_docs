Stochastic Training of GNN for Link Prediction
==============================================

This tutorial will show how to train a multi-layer GraphSAGE for link
prediction on ``ogbn-arxiv`` provided by `Open Graph Benchmark
(OGB) <https://ogb.stanford.edu/>`__. The dataset
contains around 170 thousand nodes and 1 million edges.

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to

-  Train a GNN model for link prediction on a single GPU with DGL's
   neighbor sampling components.

This tutorial assumes that you have read the :doc:`Introduction of Neighbor
Sampling for GNN Training <L0_neighbor_sampling_overview>` and :doc:`Neighbor
Sampling for Node Classification <L1_large_node_classification>`.

Link Prediction Overview
------------------------

Link prediction requires the model to predict the probability of
existence of an edge. This tutorial does so by computing a dot product
between the representations of both incident nodes.

.. math::


   \hat{y}_{u\sim v} = \sigma(h_u^T h_v)

It then minimizes the following binary cross entropy loss.

.. math::


   \mathcal{L} = -\sum_{u\sim v\in \mathcal{D}}\left( y_{u\sim v}\log(\hat{y}_{u\sim v}) + (1-y_{u\sim v})\log(1-\hat{y}_{u\sim v})) \right)

This is identical to the link prediction formulation in :doc:`the previous
tutorial on link prediction <../blitz/4_link_predict>`.

Defining Neighbor Sampler and Data Loader in DGL
------------------------------------------------

Different from the :doc:`link prediction tutorial for full
graph <../blitz/4_link_predict>`, a common practice to train GNN on large graphs is
to iterate over the edges
in minibatches, since computing the probability of all edges is usually
impossible. For each minibatch of edges, you compute the output
representation of their incident nodes using neighbor sampling and GNN,
in a similar fashion introduced in the :doc:`large-scale node classification
tutorial <L1_large_node_classification>`.

DGL provides ``dgl.dataloading.as_edge_prediction_sampler`` to
iterate over edges for edge classification or link prediction tasks.

To perform link prediction, you need to specify a negative sampler. DGL
provides builtin negative samplers such as
``dgl.dataloading.negative_sampler.Uniform``.  Here this tutorial uniformly
draws 5 negative examples per positive example.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 105-109

.. code-block:: Python


    negative_sampler = dgl.dataloading.negative_sampler.Uniform(5)









.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 110-115

After defining the negative sampler, one can then define the edge data
loader with neighbor sampling.  To create an ``DataLoader`` for
link prediction, provide a neighbor sampler object as well as the negative
sampler object created above.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 115-134

.. code-block:: Python


    sampler = dgl.dataloading.NeighborSampler([4, 4])
    sampler = dgl.dataloading.as_edge_prediction_sampler(
        sampler, negative_sampler=negative_sampler
    )
    train_dataloader = dgl.dataloading.DataLoader(
        # The following arguments are specific to DataLoader.
        graph,  # The graph
        torch.arange(graph.num_edges()),  # The edges to iterate over
        sampler,  # The neighbor sampler
        device=device,  # Put the MFGs on CPU or GPU
        # The following arguments are inherited from PyTorch DataLoader.
        batch_size=1024,  # Batch size
        shuffle=True,  # Whether to shuffle the nodes for every epoch
        drop_last=False,  # Whether to drop the last incomplete batch

The example minibatch consists of four elements.

The first element is an ID tensor for the input nodes, i.e., nodes
whose input features are needed on the first GNN layer for this minibatch.

The second element and the third element are the positive graph and the
negative graph for this minibatch.
The concept of positive and negative graphs have been introduced in the
:doc:`full-graph link prediction tutorial <../blitz/4_link_predict>`.  In minibatch
training, the positive graph and the negative graph only contain nodes
necessary for computing the pair-wise scores of positive and negative examples
in the current minibatch.

The last element is a list of :doc:`MFGs <L0_neighbor_sampling_overview>`
storing the computation dependencies for each GNN layer.
The MFGs are used to compute the GNN outputs of the nodes
involved in positive/negative graph.

Defining Model for Node Representation
--------------------------------------

The model is almost identical to the one in the :doc:`node classification
tutorial <L1_large_node_classification>`. The only difference is
that since you are doing link prediction, the output dimension will not
be the number of classes in the dataset.

Defining the Score Predictor for Edges
--------------------------------------

After getting the node representation necessary for the minibatch, the
last thing to do is to predict the score of the edges and non-existent
edges in the sampled minibatch.

The following score predictor, copied from the :doc:`link prediction
tutorial <../blitz/4_link_predict>`, takes a dot product between the
incident nodes’ representations.

                g.ndata["h"] = h
                # Compute a new edge feature named 'score' by a dot-product between the
                # source node feature 'h' and destination node feature 'h'.

                # u_dot_v returns a 1-element vector for each edge so you need to squeeze it.

Evaluating Performance with Unsupervised Learning (Optional)
------------------------------------------------------------

There are various ways to evaluate the performance of link prediction.
This tutorial follows the practice of `GraphSAGE
paper <https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/pubs/graphsage-nips17.pdf>`__.
Basically, it first trains a GNN via link prediction, and get an embedding
for each node.  Then it trains a downstream classifier on top of this
embedding and compute the accuracy as an assessment of the embedding
quality.


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 253-263

To obtain the representations of all the nodes, this tutorial uses
neighbor sampling as introduced in the :doc:`node classification
tutorial <L1_large_node_classification>`.

.. note::

   neighbor sampling during inference, please refer to this :ref:`user
   guide <guide-minibatch-inference>`.

Evaluating Performance with Link Prediction (Optional)
------------------------------------------------------

In practice, it is more common to evaluate the link prediction
model to see whether it can predict new edges. There are different
evaluation metrics such as
`AUC <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic#Area_under_the_curve>`__
or `various metrics from information retrieval <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_measures_(information_retrieval)>`__.
Ultimately, they require the model to predict one scalar score given
a node pair among a set of node pairs.

Assuming that you have the following test set with labels, where
``test_pos_src`` and ``test_pos_dst`` are ground truth node pairs
with edges in between (or *positive* pairs), and ``test_neg_src``
and ``test_neg_dst`` are ground truth node pairs without edges
in between (or *negative* pairs).

    # Positive pairs
    # These are randomly generated as an example.  You will need to
    # replace them with your own ground truth.
    n_test_pos = 1000
    test_pos_src, test_pos_dst = (
        torch.randint(0, graph.num_nodes(), (n_test_pos,)),
        torch.randint(0, graph.num_nodes(), (n_test_pos,)),
    )
    # Negative pairs.  Likewise, you will need to replace them with your
    # own ground truth.

    test_neg_dst = torch.randint(0, graph.num_nodes(), (n_test_pos,))

First you need to compute the node representations for all the nodes
with the ``inference`` method above:

Since the predictor is a dot product, you can now easily compute the
score of positive and negative test pairs to compute metrics such
as AUC:

.. code-block:: Python


    h_pos_src = node_reprs[test_pos_src]
    h_pos_dst = node_reprs[test_pos_dst]
    h_neg_src = node_reprs[test_neg_src]
    h_neg_dst = node_reprs[test_neg_dst]
    score_pos = (h_pos_src * h_pos_dst).sum(1)
    score_neg = (h_neg_src * h_neg_dst).sum(1)
    test_preds = torch.cat([score_pos, score_neg]).cpu().numpy()
    test_labels = (
        torch.cat([torch.ones_like(score_pos), torch.zeros_like(score_neg)])
        .cpu()
        .numpy()
    )

    auc = sklearn.metrics.roc_auc_score(test_labels, test_preds)
    print("Link Prediction AUC:", auc)
